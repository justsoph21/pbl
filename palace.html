          <div class="card"><p>Shwebon Yadana Mingalar Palace is a royal palace located in Shwebo, Myanmar. It was originally built in 1753 AD by King Alaungphaya U Aung Zeya, who was the first founder of the Konbaung dynasty and was the capital city until 1760 when the capital was moved to nearby Sagain. The palace is centered on a large graduated pavilion and has two walls. The outer wall forms a 3.5 km square closure, surrounded by a moat. The tomb of King Alaungpaya is located to the southeast of the palace building. It was reconstructed in 1999 based on a mid-19th-century manuscript on a November 1853 expedition to collect the remaining timber posts of the palace, carve them out, and turn them into sacred images.</p></div>
