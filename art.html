          <div class="card"><p>Hsaing waing, commonly dubbed the Burmese traditional orchestra, is a traditional Burmese folk musical ensemble that accompanies numerous forms of rituals, performances, and ceremonies in modern-day Myanmar (Burma). Hsaing waing musicians use a hemitonic and anhemitonic scale similar to the one used by Indonesian gamelan musicians. The ensemble’s principal instruments, including the pat waing, kyi waing, and hne, each play variations on a single melody (heterophony).

          <div class="card"><p>The saung, is an arched harp used in traditional Burmese music. The saung is regarded as a national musical instrument of Burma. The saung is unique in that it is a very ancient harp tradition and is said to be the only surviving harp in Asia.The saung is classified as an arched horizontal harp since the resonator body is more horizontal as opposed to the Western harp, which has a vertical resonator. The main parts of the harp are the body, the long curved neck, carved out of the root of a tree, and a string bar running down the center of the top of the body.

          <div class="card"><p>Pattala is a Burmese xylophone consisting of 24 bamboo slats suspended over a boat-shaped resonating chamber. It is played with two padded mallets and is tuned similar to the diatonic scale ¹. In modern days, classical Burmese chamber music is accompanied by either the pattala or the saung (the Burmese harp), both of which are capable of performing a harmonic countermelody. The pattala is also a key instrument in the Burmese ensemble orchestra, the hsaing waing.</p></div>
