            <p>Myanmar lies between two great and very different cultures which have influenced not only religion, culture, and arts, but also the preparation of food. During the colonial period, the influx of Chinese and Indians also had an impact on Myanmar's traditional food, introducing new items. With the advent of globalization and trade liberalization, the most famous foods from around the world are available in the cities, yet the majority of Myanmar people still cherish their own food, ensuring that its essence and uniqueness remain unchanged.</p>
