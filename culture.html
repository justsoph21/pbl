            <p>The culture of Myanmar (also known as Burma) has been heavily influenced by Buddhism and its neighbors such as India, China, and Thailand. British colonial rule has also influenced aspects of Burmese culture, including language and education1. Myanmar’s culture is an amalgam of royal and common traditions. The most popular dramatic form is the pwe, which is performed outdoors. There are a variety of pwe genres, including both human and puppet theatre, and most draw subject matter from the Jataka tales—stories of the former lives of the Buddha2. Myanmar also has a rich tradition of music and musical instruments.</p>
