          <div class="card"><p>The most widely recognized Burmese national costume is the longyi, which is worn by both males and females nationwide. It is a sheet of cloth sewn into a cylindrical shape and is worn around the waist, running to the feet. It is held in place by folding the fabric over without a knot and is sometimes folded up to the knee for comfort. Burmese clothing also features great diversity in terms of textiles, weaves, fibers, colors, and materials, including velvet, silk, lace, muslin, and cotton.</p></div>

          <div class="card"><p>The Kachin people inhabit the Kachin Hills of northern Myanmar as well as bordering areas in China and India. The traditional dress of Kachin women includes a wrap skirt, an ornamented black velveteen jacket, anklets, and waist hoops. These garments and accessories make up the key components of Kachin traditional dress, which is similar today.
            Kachin men wear shirts, traditional jackets, sarong-like longyis or slacks. They also wear turbans or headdresses with tassels hanging loose on one end on the right side of their head.</p></div>

          <div class="card"><p>The Chin “longyi is like the Myanmar “longyi” except it has bold stripes. Chin women wear longyis long enough to cover their ankles, and decorated with horizontal stripes, diamonds or flower designs. Their open-front blouses buttoned in the center, with short sleeves with checkered designs along the edge. They also wear a broad band of silver and bronze wires around their waists. On festival days, they wear beautifully woven with silk blankets.

            Chin people do not wear these traditional dresses in daily life. They wear these on special occasions like Sundays, Weddings, Chin National Day, Christmas, and any other important occasion.
